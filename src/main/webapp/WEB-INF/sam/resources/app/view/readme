In the view folder we will create all view classes, also known as the UI
Components (User Interface Components), such as the Grid panel, the Tree
panel, the Menu, the Form panel, the Window, and so on. In these classes we
will only code what the user will see on the screen; we will not handle the
events fired by a component (the Grid panel, the Tree panel, the Menu, the
Form panel, the Window are subclasses of the Component class).
